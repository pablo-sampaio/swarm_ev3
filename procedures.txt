Give detailed instruction on how to prepare an EV3

1. Download stretch or jessie / flash

2. Boot / connect USB cable

3. Net configuration on EV3 / PC

4. VS Code / plugin 


Problem in Ubuntu 18.04: The PC would show "Ethernet connecting" (never "Ethernet connected"), 
then dropped after few minutes. I had to manually ask the PC to connect again.

I solved by changing a few things - I don't know which one worked:
   - EV3: Wireless and Networks / All Network Connections / Wired / 
        Connect automatically - disable / IPV4 / Change / Load linux defauls (probably could set any config here)
   - PC: Settings / Network / you should see the option "USB Ethernet"
        IPV4 manual - in "Address" copy settings from EV3, let the other in Automatic /
        IPV6 disabled
   - Everytime you restart (PC or EV3): in EV3: go all the way to "Wired" menu, click "Connect"
